# Raylib Setup using Premake5
This is a simplified set of instructions for how to setup a project using premake.

# Generate Projects
For windows users, there are two batch files you can use depending on what compiler you are using. For linux users you can simply use a terminal.
Only do ONE of these options depending on your compiler and platform.
## Windows Users
Visual Studio users should run

    premake-VisualStudio.bat
	
This will generate a Visual Studio project.
	
## MinGW-w64 Users
Run the batch file.

    premake-mingw.bat

This will generate a makefile for you
	
## Linux users
cd to the game folder and run

    ./premake5 gmake2

This will generate a makefile for you.

## macOS users
cd to the game folder and run

    ./premake5.osx gmake2
	
This will generate a makefile for you.

# Build your game
Only do ONE of these options depending on your compiler and platform.
## Windows Users
Double click the .sln file that was generated in the folder. If you are using Visual Studio 2022 you will be asked to upgrade the project, the defaults are fine, accept them and it will load.
From here you can use the project as normal.
	
## MinGW-w64 Users
Open your compiler terminal (w64devkit if you are using it), change to the game folder and type 

    make
	
This will build your game
	
## Linux/macOS users
Open your terminal, change to the game folder and type.

    make
	
This will build your starting game template
	
	
# Building for other OpenGL targets
If you need to build for a different OpenGL version than the default (OpenGL 3.3) you can specify an openGL version in your premake command line. Just modify the bat file or add the following to your command line

## For OpenGL 1.1
--graphics=opengl11

## For OpenGL 2.1
--graphics=opengl21

## For OpenGL 4.3
--graphics=opengl43

# Building extra libs
If you need to add a separate library to your game you can do that very easily.
Simply copy the _lib folder and rename it to what you want your lib to be called.
Replace lib.c with the sources for your library (just copy them in the folder).
If you library has an include folder, copy that too.
Then go to the premake5.lua file in the game folder, and link your library by calling link_to with the folder name for the library.

link_to("LIB_FOLDER_NAME")

Rerun premake and it will build your library for you.
Note that by default link_to will add include dirs for your library folder and library/include. If you have other include needs you will have to add those to your premake file manually.
